Exercises 2.1

At the end of each of the exercises below, use the cat command to verify your answer.

Using echo and >, make files called line_1.txt and line_2.txt containing the first and second lines of Sonnet 1, respectively.
Replicate the original sonnet_1.txt (containing the first two lines of the sonnet) by first redirecting the contents of line_1.txt and then
appending the contents of line_2.txt. Call the new file sonnet_1_copy.txt, and confirm using diff that itâ€™s identical to sonnet_1.txt.
Hint: When there is no diff between two files, diff simply outputs nothing.
Use cat to combine the contents of line_1.txt and line_2.txt in reverse order using a single command, yielding the file sonnet_1_reversed.txt.
 Hint: The cat command can take multiple arguments.
